            <h2>An Exerpt from The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>
            <div>
                <p>He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read of the swallows that fly in and
                    out of the little cafe at Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned
                    merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he read of the Obelisk in
                    the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be
                    back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white
                    vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming
                    mud; he began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that
                    curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the "monstre charmant" that couches in
                    the porphyry-room of the Louvre. But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and
                    a horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be out of England? Days would
                    elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every
                    moment was of vital importance.</p>

                <p>They had been great friends once, five years before--almost inseparable, indeed. Then the intimacy
                    had come suddenly to an end. When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan
                    Campbell never did.</p>

                <p>He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and
                    whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His
                    dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time
                    working in the laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.
                    Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own in which he
                    used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart
                    on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up
                    prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the
                    piano better than most amateurs. In fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray
                    together--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever
                    he wished--and, indeed, exercised often without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady
                    Berkshire's the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen together
                    at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For eighteen months their intimacy lasted.
                    Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian
                    Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life. Whether or not a quarrel
                    had taken place between them no one ever knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke
                    when they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray
                    was present. He had changed, too--was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike
                    hearing music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he
                    was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise. And this was certainly
                    true. Every day he seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice
                    in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious experiments.</p>

                <p>This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept glancing at the clock. As the
                    minutes went by he became horribly agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the
                    room, looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides. His hands were curiously
                    cold.</p>

                <p>The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with feet of lead, while he by
                    monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew
                    what was waiting for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands his burning
                    lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into their
                    cave. It was useless. The brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made
                    grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain, danced like some foul puppet
                    on a stand and grinned through moving masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,
                    slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being dead, raced nimbly on in
                    front, and dragged a hideous future from its grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very
                    horror made him stone.</p>

                <p>At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes upon him.</p>

                <p>"Mr. Campbell, sir," said the man.</p>

                <p>A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back to his cheeks.</p>
