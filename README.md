 ## The About Me Project!
 This project was meant for us students to learn and understand the different steps in the use of HTML to create basic webpages. We also used CSS to style and format pages, learned how to verify and debug code to improve our webpages. We learned to be adapt our webpages to accessibility issues, and learned to be aware of good desing principles and responsive programming.

 ## Hero Section
 In this section, I learned how to link images and make it appear onto our webpage. I also made use of the p tag to add text to explain who I am and where I was from.

 ## Bio Section
 In our bio section, I made use of embedding links to other pages onto my webpage. I linked an Instagram page as an example.

 ## Hobbies Section
 In this section, we had some fun and made use of the list tags. In my case, I used the unordered list to name some of my hobbies.

## Gallery Section
In this section, I used the skill of linking images to show a picture gallery. I also made use of the hr tag to seperate the three images I used. I also used the figure tag to incorporate seperate captions for each image

## Article Section
In the article section, I used the article element to include an article into my webpage.

## Video Section
In this section, I made use of embedding media. More specifically, I was able to embed a YouTube video into my webpage for viewers to see on it.

## Form Section
In the form section, I used the form element to create a contact form. Viewers are able to submit forms that I can see.

## Nav Bar Section
In the Nav Bar section, I was able to use the nav element to incorporate a navbar onto my webpage. This would save viewers and readers from scrolling as it would scroll for you with ease to whichever section the viewer desires.


## The CSS Used
CSS was used in every bit of this project. It was used for the background color, the font used, the color of the font used, and the way that the overall webpage was formatted.

## Color Scheme
I was going for a really simplistic/minimalistic webpage design to begin with. I knew I wanted a dark background as all my devices are in dark mode as I want to save my eyes from melting, so I figured to put the webpage I was designing in dark mode as well. As for the color of the everything else, I went with a simple light gray. This was to make it easily readible to those who have trouble with contrast. It was simple and effective.
