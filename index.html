                <p>A future computer programmer</p>
                <p>A future pro powerlifter</p>
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ianskilos/">Powerlifting Instagram</a>
                   <p> 
                    I am a driven individual with a passion for both technology and fitness. From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and the power they held to make the world a better place. This fascination led me to pursue a career in computer programming, with the goal of using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.
                    
                    As I pursue my education and gain experience in the field, I have also discovered a love for powerlifting. The combination of mental and physical strength required to excel in this sport spoke to me on a deep level, and I found that the discipline and dedication required to be a successful powerlifter translated well to my work in computer programming.
                    
                    Now, I strive to balance my career as a computer programmer with my passion for powerlifting. I spend my free time training and pushing myself to become a stronger, more skilled athlete, while also continuing to learn and grow in my profession.
                    
                    Looking to the future, I have big aspirations for both my career and my athletic pursuits. I hope to become a top-level powerlifter, competing on a national or even international level. At the same time, I want to continue to advance in my career as a computer programmer, taking on challenging projects and using my skills to make a positive impact on the world.
                    
                    Overall, I am a determined and dedicated individual who is driven to excel in both my personal and professional pursuits. With a combination of passion, hard work, and a commitment to continuous improvement, I am poised for success as both a computer programmer and a pro powerlifter.

            <h2>How to Embed a static Google Map using iFrame</h2>
            <div>
                
                    <p>Google Maps is a popular tool for displaying locations and directions on a website. Embedding a static Google Map using an iFrame is a simple and effective way to display a map on a website without requiring the user to interact with the map.
                    
                    An iFrame is an HTML tag that allows you to embed content from another website into your own website. Using an iFrame to embed a static Google Map on your website is easy and only requires a few simple steps.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 1: Generate the Static Map URL</h4>
                    
                    <P>The first step to embedding a static Google Map using an iFrame is to generate the static map URL. To do this, go to the Google Maps website and navigate to the location you want to display on your website. Once you have found the location, click on the “Share” button located at the bottom of the screen.
                    
                    A pop-up window will appear with two options: “Share Link” and “Embed Map”. Select “Embed Map” and you will be provided with an HTML code to embed the map on your website. However, to generate the static map URL, you will need to modify this HTML code.
                    
                    In the HTML code, you will see a URL that begins with “https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/”. Modify this URL by adding the “/map?” parameter at the end of the URL. This will generate the static map URL that you will use to embed the map on your website.</P>
                    
                    <h4>Step 2: Create the iFrame</h4>
                    
                    <P>The next step is to create the iFrame that will display the static Google Map on your website. To do this, add the following code to your website:
                    
                    Replace “YOUR_MAP_ID” with the static map URL that you generated in Step 1. You can also adjust the width and height of the iFrame to fit your websites design.</P>
                    
                    <h4>Step 3: Customize the Map</h4>
                    
                    <p>Once you have added the iFrame to your website, you can customize the map by adding markers, changing the zoom level, and adjusting the map type. To do this, modify the static map URL by adding parameters to the end of the URL.
                    
                    For example, to add a marker to the map, add the following parameter to the URL: “&markers=color:red%7Clabel:A%7Clatitude,longitude”. Replace “latitude” and “longitude” with the coordinates of the location you want to mark on the map.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 4: Add Accessibility Features</h4>
                    
                   <p>Its important to ensure that your website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. When embedding a static Google Map using an iFrame, its important to add accessibility features such as alternative text and a title attribute to the iFrame.
                    
                    To add alternative text to the iFrame, add the “alt” attribute to the iFrame tag, like this:
                    
                    
                    
                    Replace “[Location Name]” with the name of the location displayed on the map.
                    
                    To add a title attribute to the iFrame, add the “title” attribute to the iFrame tag, like this:
                    
                    
                    Replace “[Location Name]” with the name of the article:</p>

                    <h4>Step 5: Test the Map</h4>
                    
                    <p>After you have embedded the static Google Map on your website using an iFrame, its important to test the map to ensure that it is working properly. Check that the map is displaying the correct location, markers are placed correctly, and the map is accessible.
                    
                    You can also test the map on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that it is responsive and displays correctly on all devices.</p>
                    
                    <p>Embedding a static Google Map using an iFrame is a simple and effective way to display a map on a website without requiring the user to interact with the map. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily generate a static map URL, create an iFrame, customize the map, and add accessibility features.
                    
                    With the popularity of Google Maps, embedding a static map on your website can enhance the user experience and provide valuable information to visitors. By using an iFrame, you can easily embed a map on your website and customize it to fit your needs.</p>
